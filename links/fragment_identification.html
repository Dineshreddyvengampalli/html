            <h2>microservices architecture</h2>
            <p>
                An event-driven architecture uses events to trigger and communicate
                between decoupled services and is common in modern applications built
                with microservices. An event is a change in state, or an update, like
                an item being placed in a shopping cart on an e-commerce website.
                Events can either carry the state (the item purchased, its price, 
                and a delivery address) or events can be identifiers (a notification 
                that an order was shipped). Event-driven architectures have three key 
                components: event producers, event routers, and event consumers.
                A producer publishes an event to the router, which filters and pushes
                the events to consumers. Producer services and consumer services are
                decoupled, which allows them to be scaled, updated, and deployed 
                independently.

            <h2>microservices architecture</h2>
            <p>
                Microservices architecture (often shortened to microservices) refers to
                an architectural style for developing applications. Microservices allow
                a large application to be separated into smaller independent parts, with
                each part having its own realm of responsibility. To serve a single user
                request, a microservices-based application can call on many internal
                microservices to compose its response.

            <h2>monolithic architecture</h2>

            A monolithic application is built as a single unified unit while a microservices
            architecture is a collection of smaller, independently deployable services.
            Which one is right for you? It depends on a number of factors. 
            In 2009 Netflix faced growing pains. Its infrastructure couldn’t keep up with the demand
            for its rapidly growing video streaming services. The company decided to migrate its IT
            infrastructure from its private data centers to a public cloud and replace its monolithic
            architecture with a microservices architecture. The only problem was, the term 
            “microservices” didn’t exist and the structure wasn’t well-known.
